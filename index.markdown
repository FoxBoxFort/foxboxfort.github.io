Hello, I'm a fox on the internet, and now you know.

I'm [ace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality) & [nb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender) (you can't misgender me, dw). I use this account to explore lewd ideas and intersting stuff (i.e. anything I would feel uncomfortable telling co-workers about).

I enjoy power fantasies a bit, in particular, hypnosis.

Being ace, I have an odd relation with lewd stuff, mainly anything involving nudity will need pre-talk. 

On that note, pre-talk and concent are super important. I would enjoy just talking about safety stuff for hours. I can also nerd out about other safety stuff thanks to my work experience. 

I'm also autistic, which means I tend to infodump (like above but X40 length). I also get burnout. I'll make an attempt to talk with the friends I've made here, but I may lose my ability to post to the massess or respond to random hellos. 

If you wanna reach out directly but we haven't talked before; ask a question (or for a favor), make an statement you find interesting or intoducre youtself. Dosen't need to be directed at me, I just need to see it if I click your profile or search for you in servers we share. I have 1 post about a spiral I made, I think you'll find my bar is very low. I just overthink simple "hellos" during burnout and in general.  

I'm a switch but with a lot of caviats. Mainly my safety oriented brain is less ok with messing with people idk well. Especially since my top interest is in hypnosis and I know how to pull myself out of trance better than most. Also I suck at being a hypnotist and refuse to give a subpar trance.

I'm working on a few fun projects. I had a few VRChat & VR projects, but those are on hold until I get my gear working again. I'm also working on a remote controlled spiral in the browser thing. Biggest hold on that is safety & concent systems and a modular system for a spiral controll and other hypnotist goodies (audio and other visual fixations. Maybe even subliminal stuff, idk).

I'm a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) dev w/ experience in Unity (C#, HLSL, etc.) very basic web dev (raw HTML+CSS and JS or Rust via WASM) and bare esentials in a few other languages (Python, Java, arduino stuff and BASH). I do more ofcourse but that's the jist it.

I use Arch btw >:3 (but I mostly use windows tbh)

Finally, you can ignore everything else on this page. It's a template theme that comes with jekyll. (I'll fix when less burned out)
